## Quicked Website – Fast Food Ordering Experience

Quicked Website is a **premium single‑page web experience** for ordering fast food online. It’s designed to feel like a high‑end product site for your client, with strong visuals, modern typography, and smooth, professional animations.

### Features

- **Hero section with 3D hologram effect** on the main burger card.
- **Signature menu** showcasing burgers, pizza, and drinks with large imagery.
- **Today’s offers** section for limited‑time promotions and upsells.
- **Order / demo request form** highlighting a **$400,000** engagement.
- **Testimonials** and **footer contact** to build trust.
- Smooth scroll navigation, scroll‑reveal animations, and responsive layout for desktop and mobile.

### File structure

- `index.html` – Main page structure and content.
- `styles.css` – Visual design, layout, and animations.
- `script.js` – Smooth scrolling, reveal effects, and hero 3D motion.
- `assets/` – Image files used by the site (burger, pizza, drink, etc.).

### Setting up images

Create an `assets` folder next to `index.html` if it doesn’t exist:

```text
Website/
  index.html
  styles.css
  script.js
  assets/
    burger-hero.png
    burger-card.png
    pizza.png
    drink.png
```

Place your food photos into `assets/` and rename them exactly as shown above so all sections display correctly.

### How to preview locally (Windows)

1. Open `C:\Users\HP\Desktop\Website` in File Explorer.
2. Double‑click `index.html` to open it in your default browser.
3. Scroll through the page to see the hero, menu, offers, order form, testimonials, and footer.

For a more realistic preview, you can serve it via a simple HTTP server (for example, using `npx serve` or Python’s `http.server`), but this is optional for basic viewing.

### Customization

- Update texts directly in `index.html` (section headings, menu items, offers, testimonials, etc.).
- Adjust colors, spacing, and animations in `styles.css` to match your client’s brand.
- Extend `script.js` if you want to add real ordering logic, cart behavior, or API integrations later.
